![](20220716_163613.png)My reseach interests lie at the intersection of public policy analysis and management information systems. Toward better public-sector decision-making, my interests are

-   \(i\) policy analysis and evalutation; specifically societal impact of information systems

-   \(ii\) evidence-based public policy and management (EBPPM)

    -   being evidence-based is being data-driven?

    -   what is the difference between evidence-based approach and contemporary policy analysis ? (such as discourse policy analysis)

    -   how to bridge the gap between researchers and practitioners?\
        Two-communities Theory (Caplan, 1979; Weiss, 1979; Newman et al., 2016 )

    -   Positivist vs. Constructivist

-   \(iii\) organizational decision-making; specifically human-machine cooperation in organizational behavior.

Methodologically, I'm interested in applied econometrics for quasi-experimental approach, machine-learning as well as other computational methods for both business and public data analytics, and applied psychology survey analysis. Also I have prior experience in policy analysis techniques (such as Cost-Benefit Analysis, Analytic Hierarchy Process etc.)
