**1. Management information systems**

-   public value in IT

-   quantifying societal impact of information systems

-   experimental and quasi-experimental policy evaluation

**3. Organization theory and behavior**

-   strategic decision-making

-   human-machine cooperation in organizational decision-making

**4. Evidence-based public policy and management (EBPPM)**

-   being evidence-based is being data-driven?

-   what is the difference between evidence-based approach and contemporary policy analysis? (such as discourse policy analysis)

-   positivism vs. constructivism in research utilization

<b> Methodologically</b>, I'm interested in applied econometrics for quasi-experimental approach, machine-learning as well as other computational methods for both business and public data analytics, and I/O psychology survey analysis. Also I have prior experience in policy analysis techniques (such as Cost-Benefit Analysis, Analytic Hierarchy Process etc.)
