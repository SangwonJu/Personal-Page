</p>
```

**1. Policy analysis and program evaluation**

- experimental and quasi-experimental policy evaluation

- specifically, information policy or social policy 

**2. Organization theory and behavior**

-   strategic decision-making

-   human-machine cooperation in organizational decision-making

**3. Computational Social Science**

**4. Evidence-based Decision-Making in public policy and management (EBPPM)**

-   being evidence-based is being data-driven?

-   what is the difference between evidence-based approach and contemporary policy analysis? (such as discourse policy analysis)

-   positivism vs. constructivism in research utilization

**5. Management information systems**

- public value in IT

- quantifying societal impact of information systems

<b> Methodologically</b>, I'm interested in applied econometrics for quasi-experimental approach, machine-learning as well as other computational methods for both business and public data analytics, and I/O psychology survey analysis. Also I have prior experience in policy analysis techniques (such as Cost-Benefit Analysis, Analytic Hierarchy Process etc.)
