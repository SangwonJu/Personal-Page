![](20220716_163613.png)My research interests lie at the intersection of public policy analysis and management information systems. Toward better public-sector decision-making, my interests are

-   **(0) policy analysis and program evaluation**

-   **(1) management information systems**

    -   quantifying societal impact of information systems

-   **(2) evidence-based public policy and management (EBPPM)**

    -   being evidence-based is being data-driven?

    -   what is the difference between evidence-based approach and contemporary policy analysis? (such as discourse policy analysis)

    -   Positivist vs. Constructivist

-   **(3) organization theory and behavior**

    -   Strategic decision-making

    -   human-machine cooperation in organization decision-making.

Methodologically, I'm interested in applied econometrics for quasi-experimental approach, machine-learning as well as other computational methods for both business and public data analytics, and applied psychology survey analysis. Also I have prior experience in policy analysis techniques (such as Cost-Benefit Analysis, Analytic Hierarchy Process etc.)
