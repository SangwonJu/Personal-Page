<h3> <b> About Me </b> </h3>
<p align="justify">
Hi. I'm currently a Ph.D. student in <A href = "http://gspa.snu.ac.kr/en" target = "blank" > Graduate School of Public Administration</A> at Seoul National University, 
Republic of Korea. I'm studying public management, organization theory and behavior, AI and evidence-based practices, government IT strategy, and computational social science. Generally, my work focuses on understanding how public organizations and their employees contribute to creating public value. Also, I aim to investigate how researchers can improve organizational decision-making by examining the importance of effective learning and knowledge management within and surrounding organizations. Additionally, I study the interaction between humans, artificial intelligence, and information systems within public organizations.
