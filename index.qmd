<h3> <b> About Me </b> </h3>
<p align="justify">
Hi. I'm currently a Master's student in <A href = "http://gspa.snu.ac.kr/en" target = "blank" > Graduate School of Public Administration</A> at Seoul National University, 
Republic of Korea. I'm studying strategic decision-making, organization theory, evidence-based practices in public sector, government IT strategy and management, and computational social science. Generally, my works seeks to quantify impact of policies on acquiring public values, understand interaction between information systems and public policy process, and figure out how researchers can contribute to improving organizational decision-making by adequately utilizing evidence-based practices.
