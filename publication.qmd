    -   Abstract: The present study explores the process of evidence-based policy (EBP) implementation in five Asian countries including Myanmar, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea. Building on the model of Evidence-based Practice Implementation (EPIS framework; Aarons et al., 2011; Moullin et al., 2019), this study conducted an exploratory comparative case study on five policy cases--a single policy case from each of the five Asian countries--and evaluated the extent to which each policy case has accomplished each of the four levels (i.e., exploration, preparation, implementation, sustainment) of EBP implementation suggested by the EPIS framework. Our findings suggest that the evaluation of the five EBP cases in Asian countries ranged from level 1 (exploration) to level 2 (preparation) out of a total of four levels. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.
