    -   Abstract: <br> The present study explores the process of evidence-based policy (EBP) implementation in five Asian countries including Myanmar, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea. Building on the model of Evidence-based Practice Implementation (EPIS framework; Aarons et al., 2011; Moullin et al., 2019), this study conducted an exploratory comparative case study on five policy cases--a single policy case from each of the five Asian countries--and evaluated the extent to which each policy case has accomplished each of the four levels (i.e., exploration, preparation, implementation, sustainment) of EBP implementation suggested by the EPIS framework. Our findings suggest that the evaluation of the five EBP cases in Asian countries ranged from level 1 (exploration) to level 2 (preparation) out of a total of four levels. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.

(Submitted to *Public Administration Review*)
    - Abstract: <br> This article explores the role of social motivation for compliance in the context of uncertainty induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The focus is on how citizens' calculative (out of deterrent fear) and normative (out of sense of duty) compliance motivation are biased by their ideological self-categorization in response to coercive prevention policies. Thus, this article conducted a three-way interaction analysis using survey data from citizens of the United States and South Korea. The results indicate that there is a comparative influence of ideological identification on the association between compliance motivations and dissonance in compliance. Furthermore, the degree of the categorization effect was affected by the individualistic-collectivistic cultural dimension of the country of residence. By integrating the social identity approach into research on policy compliance, this study emphasizes the importance of considering citizens' propensity to adhere to in-group norms as a crucial factor in effectively managing their cooperation during widespread crises.

(Preparation in manuscript, Target journal: *Government Information Quarterly*)  
    - Abstract: <br> In the last three decates, e-government researchers focused on various aspects of information technology, including the technology itself, how organizations utilize it, and its application in diverse contexts. Nevertheless, there has been limited theoretical discussion and empirical evidence on how these factors influence attaining strategic aspirations in public organizations.
    
    Thus, This study aims to examine how investing in IT resources can enhance the capabilities of public organizations and subsequently improve the overall performance of the organization. Based on the resource-based view (RBV) and public value theory, this study empirically examines the influence of IT on public-sector organizations. To examine the impact of IT investment on organizational performance, this article analyzed four-year archival panel data from 482 South Korean public enterprises and quasi-governmental institutions. The findings indicate that there is a positive relationship between the total investment in IT and operational capabilities. Furthermore, investing in IT resources has a positive overall impact on organizational performance, with operational capabilities serving as a mediator. The analysis revealed that investing in infrastructure for capacity-building, when compared to software and hardware maintenance, improves performance more. The article contributes to the understanding of e-government performance by discussing how investing in information technology can improve organizational outcomes. It also emphasizes the importance of strategic IT investment in gaining a competitive advantage in the political reputation market. In sum, this study sheds light on the intricate connection between IT resources and public organizational performance.
